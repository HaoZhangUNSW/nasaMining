The study area for this project includes all or portions of the following counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Denver, Douglas, Weld, Broomfield, and Boulder. Study area boundaries were defined to encompass the Denver Regional 2035 Urban Growth boundary, using the MPO boundary to the east and the mountain backdrop to the west. A fundamental milestone for this project was to create an up-to-date inventory of publicly accessible parks, green space, and trails. The dataset depicts publicly access parks and open space, with over 30 jurisdictions and organizations contributing data including: Counties: Adams Arapahoe Jefferson Denver Douglas Weld Broomfield Boulder Cities and Local Jurisdictions: Arvada Aurora Boulder Brighton Castle Rock Commerce City Golden Greenwood Village Highlands Ranch Ken Caryl Lakewood Littleton Longmont Louisville Parker Thornton Westminster Wheat Ridge Foot Hills Recreation District South Suburban Parks and Recreation Other Partners: Learning Landscapes DRCOG COMAP State of Colorado Colorado Open Lands", "identifier": "https://data.colorado.gov/api/views/2kpn-brzd", "title": "Greenprint Data - Parks & Open Space", "issued": "2012-05-30", "modified": "2014-12-16", "theme": ["Recreation"], "distribution": [{"downloadURL": "http://gis.drcog.org/datacatalog/content/greenprint-data-parks-open-space", "mediaType": "open dataset source in new window"}], "landingPage": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/2kpn-brzd", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:geospatial@drcog.org", "fn": "<Nobody>"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "data.colorado.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "This file contains a record for each reported traffic crash in the Region.
