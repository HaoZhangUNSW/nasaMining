The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. The CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan \"entitlement\" communities.

The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. \r\nThe CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan \"entitlement\" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to \"non-entitlement\" counties, small cities and towns. \r\nCongress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program.\r\nMaryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). \r\nFunding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income\r\nCDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and

These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - \"hubs\" and \"corridors.\" \n\nHubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres.\n\n\nCorridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or \"most natural\" routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.", "keyword": ["green infrastructure", "conservation", "landscape ecology"], "title": "Maryland Green Infrastructure Hubs and Corridors", "issued": "2013-05-06", "modified": "2014-10-24", "theme": ["Energy and Environment"], "identifier": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/hahp-aks6", "distribution": [{"downloadURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/download/hahp-aks6/application/zip", "mediaType": "application/zip; charset=binary"}], "landingPage": "https://data.maryland.gov/d/hahp-aks6", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:kjcoyne@dnr.state.md.us", "fn": "<Nobody>"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "data.maryland.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "The most popular baby names are generated by Maryland Vital Statistics data on birth records for the most current year of data available for publication (2011).", "keyword": ["births", "baby names", "vital statistics administration"], "title": "Maryland's Top Ten Most Popular Baby Names in 2011 by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex", "issued": "2013-03-08", "modified": "2014-10-30", "theme": ["Health and Human Services"], "identifier": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5", "distribution": [{"downloadURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"downloadURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "application/rdf+xml"}, {"downloadURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "application/json"}, {"downloadURL": "https://data.maryland.gov/api/views/cx3k-8nq5/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "application/xml"}], "landingPage": "https://data.maryland.gov/d/cx3k-8nq5", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:", "fn": "<Nobody>"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "data.maryland.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "The Maryland Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), is a is a statewide telephone survey that tracks prevalence and trends over time for many health variables.
