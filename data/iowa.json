The Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) is the state of Iowa's central repository for criminal history data and responsible for maintaining all Iowa fingerprint-based criminal history records. The criminal history database is comprised of records submitted to the DCI by law enforcement agencies and clerks of court throughout the state. Our criminal history database consists of arrest and conviction information for serious misdemeanors and felonies as well as some simple misdemeanors. The completeness of criminal history data is dependent upon the information submitted by the law enforcement agencies and clerks of court throughout the state of Iowa. Therefore, the DCI cannot guarantee or certify that a person has not, in fact, been arrested or convicted in Iowa.", "keyword": ["arrests", "convictions", "criminal history", "felonies", "serious misdemeanors", "simple misdemeanors"], "title": "Iowa Criminal History Database", "issued": "2015-03-27", "modified": "2015-04-10", "theme": ["Communities & People"], "identifier": "https://data.iowa.gov/api/views/4zi9-nmbb", "distribution": [{"downloadURL": "https://iowacriminalhistory.iowa.gov/default.aspx", "mediaType": "online database"}], "landingPage": "https://data.iowa.gov/d/4zi9-nmbb", "contactPoint": {"hasEmail": "mailto:cchinfo@dps.state.ia.us", "fn": "<Nobody>"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "data.iowa.gov"}, "accessLevel": "public", "description": "The Missing Person Information Clearinghouse was established July 1, 1985, within the Department of Public Safety providing a program for compiling, coordinating and disseminating information in relation to missing persons and unidentified body/persons.
